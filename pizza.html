  <h2>Instrcutions:</h2>
<h3>Prepare the pizza dough:</h3>

<p1>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix until a dough forms.
    Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Shape it into a ball.
    Place the dough ball in a lightly greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it doubles in size.
    Preheat your oven to 475째F (245째C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.
    Once the dough has risen, punch it down and transfer it to a lightly floured surface. Roll it out into your desired pizza crust shape and thickness.
    Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza pan or baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
    Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.
    Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.
    Arrange your chosen veggies on top of the cheese.</p1>
    <br/>
<p2>Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and melted.
    Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</p2>
